Minecraft is awesome because you can build, craft and survive, you can help or fight your friends
or foes. Also, if you can code Minecraft allows people to make mods and plugins (Plugins are for multiplayer servers) and if you are an artist or a musician you can edit Minecraft's textures and
sounds and upload it to the world so others can look at your skills.
